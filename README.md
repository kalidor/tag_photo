# tag_photo
Simplify tagging pictures by displaying thumbnail of each and binding key to a tagname passed as argument, on MACOSX only at this time.

# Why
I need a tool to tag file quickly in order to sort a lot of pictures. DIsplaying a thumbnail make it more faster instead displaying the hole big pic.
And letter is binding to a specified tagname passed as argument. KISS method.

# Example
```
$prog.py <DIR> -t <color>:<tagname>:<letter>
$prog.py <DIR> -t red:sport_climbing:s
```
